Initial configuration
=====================

One of the divergences in API mentioned above relates to *static members*.
The original C# implementation makes heavy use of static variables, but since
GDScript doesn't support them, it uses a singleton node called
:doc:`/classes/class_inkruntime` instead. This runtime node must be added to
the scene tree before executing any of the methods of the GDScript API.

.. _autoload-singletons:

The singleton node is autoconfigured an AutoLoad singleton as long as the editor
plugin is enabled.

It's also possible to add ``res://addons/inkgd/ink_runtime.gd``
to the AutoLoad list manually if it doesn't appear in the list or was previously
removed.

.. warning::
  The singleton must be named "__InkRuntime".

When added as an AutoLoad singleton, the node will remain in the scene tree even
when the current scene changes.
